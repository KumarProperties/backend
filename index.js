            "Kumar Prospera is amongst the best upcoming projects in Pune using modern technology construction for Superstructure called the Alu-Form system wherein walls and slabs for a typical floor get cast at one time (monolithic construction). The use of aluminium formwork gives better dimensional tolerance eliminating chances of warpage/bulging. Due to this system, external walls have better weather-resistant properties, and issues related to external paint damage and water leakages are practically eliminated. Alu-Form construction also speeds up construction at the site without compromising on the quality.",
